## üöÄ Projects Completed

### 1. Traffic Pattern Detection
- **Objective:** To analyze and detect traffic flow patterns using image/video data.  
- **Description:**  
  Developed a machine learning model that identifies and classifies traffic patterns such as vehicle density and movement.  
  This project can help in optimizing traffic management systems, reducing congestion, and improving road safety.  

### 2. Crop Detection
- **Objective:** To detect and classify different crop types from agricultural images.  
- **Description:**  
  Built a computer vision model for crop detection, which can assist farmers and researchers in precision farming, yield estimation, and monitoring crop health.  
  This project highlights the application of AI in the agriculture domain to support sustainable farming practices.
